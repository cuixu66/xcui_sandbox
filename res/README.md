Found a very nice look Resume template at:
http://www.latextemplates.com/cat/curricula-vitae

Namely, the Friggeri Resume/CV template.
However I find it requires font family which is not free.

A little bit more search revealed a templcate called Fancy CV:

https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv

Fancy CV template created by Adrien Friggeri.  This template has been modified
to replace proprietary Helvetica Neue fonts by free TeX Gyre Heros and Lato
fonts.

Directory Original contains Fancy CV template.
Directory Mine contains my resume.
