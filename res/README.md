Update on Feb, 29th, 2016:
Resumes, in my email boxes, are just duplicate copies of my CV, in xcui_cv, except where the resume has a job objective.
Therefore, the MY_RESUME email chain in my email box is useless now.
All the CV updates, fetches should be to or from the directory xcui_cv.

Update on Jan 18th, 2016:
directory "xcui_cv" contains the latest cv.
The old fancy ones are temporarily abandoned.
The latest cv template is fetched from:
http://www.latextemplates.com/template/long-professional-curriculum-vitae

Old:

Found a very nice look Resume template at:
http://www.latextemplates.com/cat/curricula-vitae

Namely, the Friggeri Resume/CV template.
However I find it requires font family which is not free.

A little bit more search revealed a template called Fancy CV:

https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv

Fancy CV template created by Adrien Friggeri.  This template has been modified
to replace proprietary Helvetica Neue fonts by free TeX Gyre Heros and Lato
fonts.

Directory Original contains Fancy CV template.
Directory Mine contains my resume.
